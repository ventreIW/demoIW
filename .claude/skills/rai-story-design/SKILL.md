# Story Design

## Purpose

Create a lean story specification optimized for both human review (clear intent) and AI alignment (accurate code generation).

## Mastery Levels (ShuHaRi)

See `raise.mastery` in frontmatter.

## Context

**When to use:** Before planning ANY story. Design is never optional — it is the gemba walk that prevents duplicate components, wasted effort, and wrong approaches.

**Inputs:** Story from backlog, User Story artifact (`story.md` from `/rai-story-start`), epic scope/design documents.

## Steps

### PRIME (mandatory — do not skip)

> **Token marker** — Call `raise_session_topic(kind="design", topic="prime")` before executing this step.

Before starting Step 1, you MUST execute the PRIME protocol:

1. **Chain read**: No chain read — story-design is the first skill in the story chain.
2. **Graph query**: Execute tier1 queries from this skill's metadata using the `raise_graph_query` MCP tool. If MCP tools are not available, fall back to `rai graph query`. If graph is unavailable, note and continue.
3. **Present**: Surface retrieved patterns as context. 0 results is valid — not a failure.
4. **Code orientation**: Load SA-ranked code symbols for the current branch:
   ```bash
   rai session context -s code_context -p .
   ```
   Returns ~20 symbols ranked by structural proximity to active work modules. Empty result is valid — branch name may not match any module. Use these symbols as starting points for code exploration, not as exhaustive scope.
5. **Emit start**: Signal lifecycle start for observability.
   ```bash
   rai signal emit-work story "{story_id}" --event start --phase design 2>/dev/null || true
   ```
6. **Backlog transition** — move story to design status (non-blocking):
   ```bash
   rai backlog statuses list --issue-type Story
   ```
   Infer design status: `category=indeterminate` + name contains Design, Analysis, Discovery.
   Single candidate → transition silently. Multiple or ambiguous → ask developer. None → skip silently.
   ```bash
   rai backlog transition {story_key} {design_slug}
   ```

### Step 1: Assess Complexity

> **Token marker** — Call `raise_session_topic(kind="design", topic="complexity")` before executing this step.

| Criterion | Simple | Moderate | Complex |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Components | 1-2 | 3-4 | 5+ |
| Story points | <5 | 5-8 | >8 |
| External integrations | 0-1 | 2-3 | 4+ |
| Algorithm complexity | Trivial | Custom logic | Novel |

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Simple | Lean design — core sections, quick gemba walk |
| Moderate | Core sections + examples |
| Complex | Full spec with all sections |

> **JIT**: Before assessing complexity, query graph for patterns from similar stories
> → `aspects/introspection.md § JIT Protocol`

**Risk gate:** If story is marked HIGH RISK in epic scope, discuss risks before designing — name concerns, failure modes, and scope boundaries.

**UX gate:** If story touches human interaction (workflows, prompts, DX), recommend `/rai-research` first (~10 min).

**Integration gate:** If story name includes "dogfood", "E2E", or "integration", OR if epic has separate client/server stories developed with mocks — AC MUST include at least one scenario that runs with **real infrastructure** (docker compose, actual DB, real HTTP calls). Unit tests with mocks cannot catch cross-component contract mismatches (auth headers, payload validation, parameter limits).

### Step 2: Gemba Walk (mandatory — do not skip)

> **Token marker** — Call `raise_session_topic(kind="design", topic="gemba")` before executing this step.

Go to the actual code. Design without reading the code is guessing.

1. **Read what exists**: Open and read the files/modules that this story will touch. Understand the current state before proposing changes.
2. **Search for duplicates**: Grep for similar functionality, components, or patterns that already exist. Before creating anything new, verify it doesn't exist already.
3. **Check best practices**: Look at how similar problems are solved in the codebase. Follow established patterns rather than inventing new ones.
4. **Map dependencies**: Identify what depends on the code you'll change, and what the changed code depends on.
5. **Legacy sweep (mandatory)**: If this story introduces a V2 of something — new class, new module, new pattern that supersedes an existing one — answer **in the design doc** the question *"what V1 becomes orphaned when V2 lands?"*. Three valid answers: (a) *"nothing — this is net-new"* (state it explicitly); (b) *"V1 at `file:line` — deletion plan is X"* (commit-level plan included); (c) *"V1 coexists because Y"* (explain why keeping V1 is correct). No implicit answers. This exists because RCA s2092.1 showed refactors cierran declarados done sin barrer V1 (R1/R3/R5 · pattern `refactor-declared-done-without-sweep`).

```bash
# Example gemba commands
grep -r "similar_function" packages/  # Does this already exist?
grep -r "class SimilarModel" packages/ # Duplicate models?
```

> **JIT**: For deeper code exploration beyond the orientation map, query the graph directly:
> ```bash
> rai graph query "symbol_name" --types symbol --limit 10
> rai graph query "module_name" --module mod-session
> rai graph query "callers of function_name" --types symbol
> ```
> Use `--file path/to/file.py` to scope results to a specific file.

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Similar component exists | Reuse or extend it — do NOT create a duplicate |
| No established pattern | Document the new pattern as a design decision |
| Multiple approaches found | List them in Step 4 with trade-offs |

**Drift Risk Check** — for each module this story will touch:

1. If `governance/drift-hotspots.json` exists: check if the module appears in the top-10 ranked modules — note rank and signal count.
2. Check `governance/drift-catalog.md` §1 (AG1–AG6): does the story scope risk any of these?
   - **AG4** (context-window planning): does the change fan out across >3 modules with unresolved coupling edges?
   - **AG2** (clone amplification): are you duplicating logic that exists elsewhere?
3. Flag risks in this design doc's Approach section as signals — not blockers. "No drift risk identified" is always valid.

Graceful degradation: if `governance/drift-hotspots.json` is absent, skip step 1 silently and proceed to step 2.

<verification>
Code has been read. No duplicate components will be created. Existing patterns identified. Legacy sweep answered explicitly in design doc. Drift risk checked (hotspots rank noted if available; AG4/AG2 assessed).
</verification>

### Step 3: Frame What & Why (informed by gemba)

> **Token marker** — Call `raise_session_topic(kind="design", topic="frame")` before executing this step.

Load `story.md` (from `/rai-story-start`) if it exists — use its User Story as starting frame.

> **JIT**: Before framing problem and value, query graph for prior designs with similar scope
> → `aspects/introspection.md § JIT Protocol`

- **Problem**: What gap does this fill? (1-2 sentences)
- **Value**: Why does this matter? (1-2 sentences, measurable or observable)

</verification>

### Step 4: Describe Approach (lean principles)

> **Token marker** — Call `raise_session_topic(kind="design", topic="approach")` before executing this step.

> **JIT**: Before describing approach, query graph for implementation patterns in affected modules
> → `aspects/introspection.md § JIT Protocol`

Document WHAT you're building and WHY this approach (not detailed HOW):
- Solution approach (1-2 sentences)
- Components affected (list with change type: create/modify/delete)

**Lean design gates** — challenge every component before committing:

- **KISS**: Is this the simplest approach that works? If not, simplify.
- **DRY**: Does this duplicate logic that exists elsewhere (gemba walk should have found it)?
- **YAGNI**: Are you building for a real requirement or a hypothetical one? Cut speculative features.
- **MVP**: What is the smallest version that delivers the value from Step 3? Build that, not more.

**For refactoring:** grep all call sites of the target. A half-migration is worse than none.

**For data mutations:** What happens when inputs reference missing entities? Declare the strategy explicitly: reject with error, skip + report count, partial success with warnings. Silent drops are semantic bugs.

**Storage migration gate:** If this story replaces a storage mechanism (file → SQLite, JSON → DB, YAML → table), answer for every public function of the replaced module: *"What did callers get on (a) missing data and (b) corrupt data before? What will they get after?"* Common silent contract breaks:
- `FileNotFoundError` → empty result (callers catching the exception silently get nothing)
- `ValueError`/`JSONDecodeError` → `ValidationError` (callers expecting `None` on corrupt data now get an exception)
- File mtime → no equivalent (staleness checks break silently)

Declare the contract explicitly in the Approach section and add an AC for each broken contract you identify. Skip this gate if the story does not replace a storage mechanism.

Also run: `rai schema sum check` — advisory ⚠ if stale or missing (run `rai schema sum update`).

**Schema version coordination check:** If this story adds a `_V{N}_DDL` migration, verify that the next version number is not already taken by the dev branch:

```bash
# Current branch version
grep "^SCHEMA_VERSION" packages/raise-cli/src/raise_cli/storage/schema.py

# Dev branch version (substitute your dev branch)
git show origin/release/3.0.0:packages/raise-cli/src/raise_cli/storage/schema.py | grep "^SCHEMA_VERSION"
```

If the two versions diverge (feature branch has V18, dev branch already at V19), assign migrations starting from `max(both) + 1`. Document the chosen version in the design. Skipping this check when branches diverge causes migration number collisions at merge time — a ~30 min fix that cannot be automated away.

**Value preservation gate:** Before finalizing components, ask: "What domain knowledge does this layer provide that a generic pass-through wouldn't?" If the answer is "none", the design may be over-abstracted. If the answer involves config/resolution/mapping that an existing pattern handles differently, check where that responsibility lives in the proven pattern.

**Supply Chain Gate** — For each NEW external dependency introduced by this story, evaluate supply chain health before committing:

- **PyPI version history** — stable releases? frequent yanks?
- **Download count** — established package or niche?
- **Last release date** — actively maintained?
- **Maintainer count** — bus factor (single point of failure)?
- **Yank history** — has this package had yanked versions in the past?
- **Alternative evaluation** — can we implement this ourselves in <50 LOC? Is there a lighter alternative?
- **Isolation strategy** — is the dependency confined to a single module, or does it leak across the codebase?

Document findings in the design doc's Approach section. This is a guide, not a hard block — an informed risk decision is valid.

**Skip rule:** Well-known, widely-adopted packages (pydantic, fastapi, pytest, requests, httpx, typer, rich, click, and similar) are N/A — their supply chain health is already established. Use human judgment for the boundary.

> See pattern BASE-056: *Consumer reputation ≠ package stability — verify supply chain independently* (will be registered in RAISE-586).

For complex stories, add: scenarios (Gherkin), algorithm pseudocode, constraints, testing strategy.

### Step 5: Create Examples (MOST IMPORTANT)

> **Token marker** — Call `raise_session_topic(kind="design", topic="examples")` before executing this step.

**This section drives AI code generation accuracy more than any other.**

Provide concrete, runnable examples:
1. **API/CLI usage** — how the story is invoked
2. **Expected output** — success + error cases
3. **Data structures** — key models, schemas, types

Use concrete values (not placeholders), correct syntax (not pseudocode), consistent with codebase style.

<verification>
Examples are concrete, runnable, and cover success + error paths.
</verification>

<if-blocked>
Can't envision examples → approach not concrete enough, return to Step 3.
</if-blocked>

### Step 6: Define Acceptance Criteria

> **Token marker** — Call `raise_session_topic(kind="design", topic="ac")` before executing this step.

> **JIT**: Before defining acceptance criteria, query graph for testing patterns and quality standards
> → `aspects/introspection.md § JIT Protocol`

If `story.md` has Gherkin AC, reference them here — refine, don't duplicate. If no `story.md`, define from scratch:

- **MUST**: Required for completion (3-5 items, specific and testable)
- **SHOULD**: Nice-to-have (1-3 items)
- **MUST NOT**: Explicit anti-requirements

All criteria must be observable outcomes traceable to value from Step 2.

Criteria are specific, testable, and traceable. Spec reviewable in <5 minutes.

## Output

After completing all steps, persist the design to the artifact store and render a Markdown view:

### 1. Emit structured artifact (primary — canonical source)

Call `raise_artifact_emit` with the design content as structured JSON. The artifact store is the source of truth.

```
raise_artifact_emit(
    artifact_type="design",
    story_id="{story_id}",
    content=<JSON string with fields: problem, value, approach, components, decisions,
             acceptance_criteria, examples, complexity, dependencies, legacy_sweep,
             drift_risks, testing_strategy, open_questions>
)
```

Field reference for the `content` JSON:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `problem` | string | yes | What gap does this fill |
| `value` | string | yes | Why it matters (measurable) |
| `approach` | string | yes | Solution approach |
| `components` | list of `{name, change, purpose}` | yes | Files affected (`change`: create/modify/delete) |
| `decisions` | list of `{id, title, rationale, body?}` | yes | Design decisions (body for extended rationale) |
| `acceptance_criteria` | list of `{id, description, severity?, verifiable?, test_link?}` | yes | `severity`: must (default), should, must_not |
| `examples` | list of `{title, language?, code, explanation?}` | no | Concrete runnable examples |
| `complexity` | "simple" / "moderate" / "complex" | no | From Step 1 assessment |
| `dependencies` | list of `{description, blocks?}` | no | What this story depends on |
| `legacy_sweep` | string | no | What V1 becomes orphaned (mandatory answer from Step 2) |
| `drift_risks` | list of `{id, description, mitigation?}` | no | From drift risk check in Step 2 |
| `testing_strategy` | list of `{layer, name, purpose}` | no | Key test scenarios |
| `open_questions` | list of strings | no | Questions deferred to plan phase |

If MCP tool is unavailable, fall back to CLI:
```bash
rai artifact emit --type design --story "{story_id}" --content '<JSON>'
```

### 2. Render Markdown view (derived — for human review)

Publish rendered Markdown via CLI for human readability, git diff, and Confluence:

```bash
rai docs write story-design \
  --title "S{N}.{M}: {story-name} design" \
  --stdin \
  --output-path work/epics/e{N}-{name}/stories/s{N}.{M}-design.md << 'EOF'
[rendered Markdown from artifact store content]
EOF
```

The Markdown file is a **rendered view**, not the source of truth. It is generated from the artifact content. If the artifact store and the file ever diverge, the artifact store wins.

### 3. Emit lifecycle signal

| Item | Destination |
|------|-------------|
| Design artifact | SQLite artifact store (primary) |
| Design Markdown | `work/epics/e{N}-{name}/stories/s{N}.{M}-design.md` (rendered view) |
| Signal | WorkLifecycle event emitted (start on entry, complete here) |

```bash
rai signal emit-work story "{story_id}" --event complete --phase design 2>/dev/null || true
```

**STOP HERE.** Return your summary to the orchestrator. Do NOT invoke any further skill.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] NEVER over-specify HOW — trust AI for implementation details
- [ ] NEVER skip examples — they are the most important section
- [ ] Supply chain risk evaluated for new external dependencies (or N/A)
