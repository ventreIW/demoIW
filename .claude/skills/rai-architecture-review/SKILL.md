# Architecture Review

## Purpose

Evaluate whether code is **necessary and proportional** using Beck's four rules of simple design. Core question: "Could we achieve the same outcome with less?"

## Mastery Levels (ShuHaRi)

- **Shu**: Apply all heuristics systematically, explain each finding
- **Ha**: Focus on highest-signal heuristics for the scope, skip low-risk areas
- **Ri**: Pattern-match to known anti-patterns, minimal ceremony

## Context

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| After `/rai-story-implement` | Run with `story` scope |
| After last story in epic | Run with `epic` scope |
| Accumulated complexity feels disproportionate | Run on-demand |

**Inputs:** Scope (`story` or `epic`), design doc, changed files from git diff.

## Steps

### Step 0: Instrument

```bash
rai signal emit-work story "{story_id}" --event start --phase architecture-review 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Step 1: Load Design Context & Patterns

Before reviewing code, load what the design intended and what the codebase has learned:

1. **Code orientation**: Load SA-ranked code symbols for the current branch:
   ```bash
   rai session context -s code_context -p .
   ```
   Returns ~20 symbols ranked by structural proximity to active work modules. Empty result is valid. Use these as starting points — not exhaustive scope.
2. **Read the design doc** (`design.md` or `scope.md`) — what was the intended approach?
3. **Query the knowledge graph** for patterns in affected modules using `raise_graph_query` MCP tool with query="patterns for {affected_modules}" and `raise_pattern_query` MCP tool with keywords="{module_keywords}".

   If MCP tools are not available, fall back to:
   ```bash
   rai graph query "patterns for {affected_modules}" --types pattern
   rai pattern list --context "{module_keywords}"
   ```
4. **Load established patterns** (PAT-E-*) — these are proven solutions. Deviations need justification.

> **JIT**: For deeper code exploration beyond the orientation map, query the graph directly:
> ```bash
> rai graph query "symbol_name" --types symbol --limit 10
> rai graph query "module_name" --module mod-session
> rai graph query "callers of function_name" --types symbol
> ```
> Use `--file path/to/file.py` to scope results to a specific file.

This context informs every subsequent step: you can't judge proportionality without knowing intent, and you can't catch regressions without knowing established patterns.

### Step 2: Identify Scope and Changed Files

Detect the project language and filter by appropriate extensions:

1. **Check `.raise/manifest.yaml`** for `project.language` or `project.project_type`
2. **Fallback:** Scan extensions of changed files and pick the dominant language

```bash
# Story scope: files changed vs parent branch
git diff --name-only $(git merge-base HEAD <parent-branch>)..HEAD -- '<extensions>'
# Epic scope: all files changed vs development branch
git diff --name-only $(git merge-base HEAD <dev-branch>)..HEAD -- '<extensions>'
```

Replace `<extensions>` with language-appropriate patterns (e.g., `'*.py' '*.pyi'` for Python, `'*.ts' '*.tsx'` for TypeScript, `'*.cs'` for C#).

Read every changed file and the design doc. You cannot judge proportionality without intent context.

### Step 3: Necessity Audit (YAGNI — Beck Rule 4)

| # | Heuristic | Red Flag |
|---|-----------|----------|
| H1 | Single Implementation | Protocol/ABC with exactly one concrete implementation, no documented consumer |
| H2 | Wrapper Without Logic | Class delegates all work without adding behavior |
| H3 | Unused Parameters | Parameters accepted but never used in function body |
| H4 | Test-Only Consumers | Public function/class used exclusively by test code |
| H5 | Dead Exports | Public API includes names no consumer imports (e.g., `__all__` in Python, `export` in TS, `public` in C#) |

When a heuristic triggers, check: "Does the design doc justify this?" If yes, note as Observation.

### Step 4: Proportionality Audit (KISS — Beck Rules 2+4)

| # | Heuristic | Red Flag |
|---|-----------|----------|
| H6 | Indirection Depth | >2 layers of delegation for a simple operation |
| H7 | Abstraction-to-LOC Ratio | More scaffolding than logic |
| H8 | Configuration Over Convention | Configurable with only one valid value in practice |

### Step 5: Duplication & Responsibility (Beck Rules 2-3)

| # | Heuristic | Red Flag |
|---|-----------|----------|
| H9 | Semantic Duplication | Same concept expressed differently in multiple places |
| H10 | Pattern Duplication | Same structural problem solved differently across modules |
| H11 | Change Reason Count | Module changes for >1 unrelated reason |
| H12 | Import Fan-In | File imports from 5+ distinct packages for one function |

### Step 6: Agent-Authored Drift Audit

Check for agent-specific drift patterns at both story and epic scope. Reference `governance/drift-catalog.md` §1 for full definitions — do not copy inline.

| # | Heuristic | Signal |
|---|-----------|--------|
| AG1 | Authorization fan-out | Auth-related changes touching ≥3 downstream modules without a consolidating aggregator |
| AG2 | Clone amplification | Duplicate logic blocks in ≥2 new locations relative to surrounding modules |
| AG3 | Hallucinated-API residue | Symbol references that don't resolve; persistent across ≥2 commits |
| AG4 | Context-window planning | Fan-out of modified set has orphan edges — modules touched but not reconciled |
| AG5 | Vulnerability density | CWE-class patterns in agent-authored hunks (auth, injection, secrets) |
| AG6 | Over-specification | Conditionals keyed on literal constants from prompt examples; re-implementation of existing capability |

"No agent-authored drift detected" is always valid — do not invent findings.

### Step 7: Systemic Audit (Epic Scope Only)

Skip for story scope. Cross-module heuristics:

| # | Heuristic | Red Flag |
|---|-----------|----------|
| H13 | Orphaned Abstractions | Protocol from early story still has ≤1 implementor at epic end |
| H14 | Coupling Direction | Stable core imports from volatile/new module |
| H15 | Cyclic Dependencies | Circular import paths between modules |
| H16 | Shotgun Surgery | One logical change touches 5+ files across 3+ directories |

### Step 8: Lean Compliance Audit

Verify the implementation follows the lean principles established in design:

| # | Check | Red Flag |
|---|-------|----------|
| L1 | **MVP delivered** | Implementation exceeds what design specified — gold-plating |
| L2 | **Design followed** | Implementation diverges from design without documented ADR |
| L3 | **Pattern compliance** | Known patterns (PAT-E-*) exist for this problem but weren't used |
| L4 | **No speculative code** | Features built for hypothetical future requirements (YAGNI) |
| L5 | **Simplest approach** | A simpler implementation would achieve the same outcome (KISS) |

For each L-finding: cite the pattern or design decision that was violated.

### Step 9: Present Findings

```markdown
## Architecture Review: {id} (scope: {story|epic})

### Critical (fix before merge)
### Recommended (simplify before next cycle)
### Questions (require human judgment)
### Observations (patterns noted)
### Verdict
- [ ] PASS / PASS WITH QUESTIONS / SIMPLIFY
```

Every finding: specific file:line, heuristic ID, proportionality concern, concrete simplification.

<verification>
Verdict rendered (PASS / PASS WITH QUESTIONS / SIMPLIFY). All critical findings addressed or acknowledged by developer. Signal emitted.

## Output

| Item | Destination |
|------|-------------|
| Review findings | Presented inline, saved if requested |
| Verdict | PASS, PASS WITH QUESTIONS, or SIMPLIFY |
| Next | `/rai-story-review` (story) or `/rai-epic-close` (epic) |

```bash
rai signal emit-work story "{story_id}" --event complete --phase architecture-review 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Quality Checklist
