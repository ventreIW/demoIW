# Epic Plan

## Purpose

Transform the story list from `/rai-epic-design` into a sequenced implementation plan with milestones, parallel work streams, and progress tracking.

## Mastery Levels (ShuHaRi)

- **Shu**: Follow all steps, create sequenced plan with walking skeleton + MVP milestones
- **Ha**: Adjust milestone granularity based on epic size, skip timeline for small epics
- **Ri**: Domain-specific sequencing patterns, team velocity models

## Context

**When to use:** After `/rai-epic-design` has produced a scope document with stories. Before starting first story.

**When to skip:** Very small epics (2-3 stories) with obvious linear sequence. Emergency fixes.

**Inputs:** Epic scope document (`work/epics/e{N}-{name}/scope.md`), calibration data (if available).

## Steps

### PRIME (mandatory — do not skip)

Before starting Step 1, you MUST execute the PRIME protocol:

1. **Chain read**: Read epic-design's learning record at `.raise/rai/learnings/rai-epic-design/{work_id}/record.yaml`. Enrich epic-design's record with `downstream: {scope_clear: bool, stories_sequenceable: bool}`.
2. **Graph query**: Execute tier1 queries from this skill's metadata using the `raise_graph_query` MCP tool. If MCP tools are not available, fall back to `rai graph query`. If graph is unavailable, note and continue.
3. **Present**: Surface retrieved patterns as context. 0 results is valid — not a failure.
4. **Emit start**: Signal lifecycle start for observability.
   ```bash
   rai signal emit-work epic "{epic_id}" --event start --phase plan 2>/dev/null || true
   ```

### Step 1: Review Epic Scope

Load and understand the epic scope document:
- Story list with sizes and dependencies
- Done criteria and risks
- Architectural decisions that affect sequencing

<if-blocked>
Epic design incomplete → run `/rai-epic-design` first.
</if-blocked>

### Step 2: Sequence & Rationalize

Order stories using these strategies (in priority order):

| Strategy | When | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **Risk-first** | High uncertainty features | Tackle unknowns early while energy is high and time for pivots remains |
| **Walking skeleton** | Architecture unproven | Build minimal E2E path first to prove architecture |
| **Quick wins** | Need momentum | Early deliverable value, validate tooling |
| **Dependency-driven** | Hard blockers exist | Unblock others on critical path |

For each story, document: position, rationale, dependencies (hard/soft/external), what it enables.

> **JIT**: Before choosing sequencing strategy, query graph for ordering patterns and calibration data
> → `aspects/introspection.md § JIT Protocol`

**Identify parallel opportunities:** Stories with no mutual dependencies, different codebase areas, or independent concerns can run concurrently.

<verification>
Every story has sequencing rationale. Critical path identified. Parallel opportunities documented.
</verification>

### Step 3: Define Milestones

Create 2-4 intermediate checkpoints:

| Milestone | Typical scope | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **M1: Walking Skeleton** | 1-3 stories (smallest E2E) | Prove architecture, enable integration |
| **M2: Core MVP** | 50-70% of stories | Demonstrate value, gather feedback |
| **M3: Feature Complete** | 100% planned stories | Ready for polish |
| **M4: Epic Complete** | Done criteria met | Ready for `/rai-epic-close` |

Per milestone: stories included, success criteria (verifiable), demo capability.

> **JIT**: Before defining milestones, query graph for calibration patterns and checkpoint strategies
> → `aspects/introspection.md § JIT Protocol`

**Integration checkpoint:** For epics with multiple components (client/server, CLI/API, frontend/backend), schedule an **E2E integration milestone** before the final story. This checkpoint runs real infrastructure (docker compose, actual DB) and verifies cross-story contracts (auth headers, payload schemas, parameter limits). Unit tests with mocks cannot catch these mismatches — only real E2E validates the seams between stories.

At least 2 milestones defined with clear success criteria. Multi-component epics include E2E integration checkpoint.

### Step 4: Setup Tracking

Add progress tracking to epic scope using `templates/plan-section.md`:
- Story sequence table with status/actual/velocity columns
- Milestone checklist with target dates
- Velocity assumptions from calibration data (if available)

<verification>
Tracking table added to epic scope document.
</verification>

### Step 5: Update Scope Document

Append the implementation plan section to `work/epics/e{N}-{name}/scope.md` via CLI (preserves existing content + publishes to Confluence):

```bash
rai docs write epic-scope \
  --title "E{N}: {epic-name} scope + plan" \
  --stdin \
  --output-path work/epics/e{N}-{name}/scope.md << EOF
$(cat work/epics/e{N}-{name}/scope.md)

## Implementation Plan
{story sequence with rationale}

## Milestones
{milestones with success criteria}

{parallel work streams if any}

{progress tracking table}

### Sequencing Risks
{top 3 risks}
EOF
```

Note: unquoted heredoc so `$(cat ...)` expands the existing scope content.

Present plan to human for review before starting first story.

<verification>
Scope document updated. Plan reviewable in <5 minutes. Human acknowledges.
</verification>

## Output

| Item | Destination |
|------|-------------|
| Implementation plan | Appended to `work/epics/e{N}-{name}/scope.md` |
| Plan template | `templates/plan-section.md` |
| Next | `/rai-story-design` for first story in sequence |

Transition epic to implement status before signaling completion (non-blocking):
```bash
rai backlog statuses list --issue-type Epic
```
Infer implement status: `category=indeterminate` + name contains Implement, Progress, Development.
Single candidate → transition silently. Multiple or ambiguous → ask developer. None → skip silently.
```bash
rai backlog transition {JIRA_KEY} {implement_slug}
```

```bash
rai signal emit-work epic "{epic_id}" --event complete --phase plan 2>/dev/null || true
```

**STOP HERE.** Return your summary to the orchestrator. Do NOT invoke any further skill.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] All stories sequenced with rationale
- [ ] Critical path identified
- [ ] At least 2 milestones (walking skeleton + MVP minimum)
- [ ] Dependencies verified — no cycles, blockers identified
- [ ] Parallel opportunities documented (or explained why sequential)
- [ ] Progress tracking in scope document
- [ ] NEVER over-plan — plans are hypotheses, not commitments
- [ ] NEVER sequence by size alone — use risk-first as default
- [ ] Multi-component epics include E2E integration checkpoint
